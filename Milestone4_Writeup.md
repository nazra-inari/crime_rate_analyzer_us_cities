# Milestone 4 - Writeup  

### What changes did we implement, and why?
Given the short time duration, we wanted to make sure that any features we added would not compromise what we already had. For this reason, we kept things simple and focused on legibility. The first feature we added was a directive question as a title above the graphs. While this isn't a hard feature, it is a soft feature that directs the users mind towards how they are meant to use the app. We also added tiny bits of help text to help users with their interactions and provided graph title's to express the difference between the two graphs.

We also improved documentation and commenting in our code thereby improving readability and making it easier to come back to in the future.

### What would we do different if we started over?

Definitely allowing the user to select more than two cities to analyze was something we should have incorporated right from the start. This feature was requested unanimously in our first round of peer reviews.

Other changes would include our work styles. There were times during the project when we were fixated at on fixing a certain problem and that took up too much time. We could have used that time more judiciously, and probably given up on 1 feature but added 2 others. That was definitely a learning lesson in team dynamics.

### Greatest Challenges
The greatest challenges for our team were not as much on the execution end but on the planning end. We started our app with a plan that tried to absorb into it our technical expertise, the problem we were trying to solve and a solution that would lend itself as an easy to use data visualization app. Add to this, constraints such as the type of visual encoding that can be used, and the color palettes, and we essentially had something with a lot of moving parts. Grouping all of our knowledge together in the most effective way and having it presented such that it would act as a road map with the least possible hurdles was the hardest part. Once we had our roadmap, it was easy.
