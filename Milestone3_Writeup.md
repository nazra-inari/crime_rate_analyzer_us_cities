# Milestone 3 - Writeup  

### Reflections on Peer Reviews
We found users were able to understand the purpose of our app rather intuitively and were able to interact with our app rather easily. The limited and simple user interface we built allowed users to explore the trend in crime across US cities the data as we intended them to. There were some feature suggestions that we did take into consideration, mentioned below

### Most Requested Feature
Amongst the changes, one that stood out the most was also recommended most often. Most users wanted the ability to select more than two cities at a time. This was a reasonable request and one that we decided to incorporate into our app. The reason we had originally left this out was to prevent over cluttering of the visualization. However, this approach was limiting the possibilities of how users could interact with our app.

### Challenges incorporating all the feedback
While we do see further opportunity to improve the information conveyed by the application, we had to keep in mind the conflict between the features that were recommenced. Tools tips were ineffective when the density and concentration of the lines was high causing overlap. To prevent a degradation of the visual encoding , we chose to add features one at a time and offered careful consideration prior to adding more. This, substantiated by the time frame entailed that we couldnâ€™t  and did not want to implement all the feedback

One change that we did try incorporate but unfortunately failed to complete due to a lack of time was sorting the legends of plot in order of the level of crime in the city

### Conclusion
On the positive, users did enjoy our choice of colour palette being colour-blind friendly, and overall the feedback was valuable and did result in an improved version of our app.
